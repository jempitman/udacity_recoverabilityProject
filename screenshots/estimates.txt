1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
For a platform/site reliability team of 2 people (1 on call and the other not but still on back up duty) working in
the same AZ as an overnight outage, an RTO of 1.25hrs is anticipated. This estimate is based on the following timeline
calculation:

00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
00:51 - Root cause is discovered (25 minutes)
01:01 - Remediation started (10 minutes)
01:11 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)

Total time = 71 minutes
RTO is 1.25hrs

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
For a platform/site reliability team of 2 people (1 on call and the other not but still on back up duty) working in
the same region as an overnight outage, an RTO of 1hr45min is anticipated. This estimate is based on the following timeline
calculation:

00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:26 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (20 minutes)
00:36 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
00:56 - Root cause is discovered (20 minutes)
01:11 - Remediation is started (15 minutes)
01:41 - Remediation completed (30 minutes)

Total time = 101 minutes
RTO is 1.75hrs

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ
Assuming the backup frequency on a db is every 5 minutes and 3 back up checkpoints are missed before the platform engineering
team confirm that an AZ is down; 10 minutes for the team to identify the last reliable back up point; and a further
10 minutes to roll the database back, the minimum RPO for a single AZ would be 40 minutes.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region
Assuming the backup frequency on a db is every 5 minutes and 5 back up checkpoints are missed before the platform engineering
team confirm that a whole region is down; 15 minutes for the team to identify the last reliable back up point on the
back up db; and a further 15 minutes to promote the backup db to production, the minimum RPO for a single region would be 1 hr.
